# Patrycja's hobby page
My girlfriend's page!

### This page is meant for her as a gift. She's been dreaming for the longest time to actually show the world what she can do with the yarn (crochet stuff and all). 

So yeah im putting it here just so I can show it to other people before I finish it and finally realease it!

> TO DO: 
> - Make a mobile version
> - Make it scale nicely
> - Finally do something in JavaScript that actually makes sense to a website
> - Upload photos of her work
> - Design a home page
